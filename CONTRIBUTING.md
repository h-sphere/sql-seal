# Contributing
If you want to contribute, that's great. Welcome onboard! Before you start writing your first lines of code in SQLSeal repository, I recommend joining our Discord and checking in with other contributors what's being worked on currently. We can also help you get started with the codebase.

[Join our Discord Here](https://discord.gg/ZMRnFeAWXb).

Once you join, head to the #sqlseal-development channel and introduce yourself!

## PR good practices
- Try creating pull requests that introduce / fix single functionality.
- Add Changesets to your PRs when changes are user-facing.
- Add related documentation when needed

## Creating changesets
To create a changeset, run `pnpm exec changeset`. This will ask you few questions what type of the change you've created. We follow semver versioning strategy (in pre 1.0 mode for now).
