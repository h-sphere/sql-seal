Here are some known issues and resolutions to it

## I have changed my file but the changes are not reflected in files table
Sometimes changes might not be properly added to the `files` table. If this happens, you can call `SQLSeal: Reload vault database` command (using `CTRL + P` / `CMD + P` shortcut to activate command window). If this does not help, please report an issue on project page with details.
