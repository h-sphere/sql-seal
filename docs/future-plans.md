# Future Plans
In the short future the following features are planned for SQLSeal:
- Global tables: currently the tables are scoped to specific file to prevent name clashing. We plan to add settings panel to allow for setting up global tables
- Views: Allow to store your selects as views and query them.
- Dataview: Support for dataview data to be imported into SQLSeal.
