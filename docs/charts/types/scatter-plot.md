# Scatter Plot
You can use scatterplot

## Basics
Example below renders scatterplot comparing book wordcount and it's rating. It also adds interactive labels on hover so you know which book title point corresponds to.
We also set minimum for y axis to 1 (as this is minimal rating book can get) and x axis to log2 scale.
