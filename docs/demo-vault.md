# Demo Vault
We prepared SQLSeal Demo Vault to help you get started. It includes set of example queries that showcases some basic functionality of the plugin.
I hope for the vault to expand and become both good in-depth tutorial for the plugin and source of inspirations for the setup.

## Using the vault
To use the vault, click on the Code -> Download ZIP. Alternatively you can click [this link (ZIP file with Vault)](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal-demo-vault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once the file is downloaded, unzip it and open it in Obsidian.
The Vault has already SQLSeal installed so no extra setup should be required.
